# VMScripts - CommunityInstallers

This branch houses the launchers and installers for the environments.
The software stack given is by no means exhaustive, but a good starting\
point for learning. If you know how to work with BASH, feel free to extend\
the scripts and personalize them, otherwise as I come across other software\
that is useful, you can wait until this branch is updated again.

# Usage

 - git clone https://github.com/VictorySpecificationII/VMScripts.git
 - git checkout CommunityInstallers
 - ./MotorsportInstaller.sh

This script assumes a FRESH installation of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Happy experimentation!
