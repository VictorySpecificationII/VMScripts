# VMScripts
Scripts I use to personalize my VM installations

I have a collection of VM's, each of which serve a different purpose for me.

An EDA VM.
A Race Engineering/Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence VM.

My plan is to some time release them as complete toolchains for both EDA and Race Engineering.

These scripts are meant to give one an idea of what applications are installed on those VM's.
