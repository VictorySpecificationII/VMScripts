# VMScripts - CommunityInstallers

This branch houses the launchers and installers for the environments.
The software stack given is by no means exhaustive, but a good starting
point for learning. If you know how to work with BASH, feel free to extend
the scripts and personalize them, otherwise as I come across other software
that is useful, you can wait until this branch is updated again.

# Usage

## Motorsport VM
 - git clone https://github.com/VictorySpecificationII/VMScripts.git
 - git checkout CommunityInstallers
 - ./MotorsportInstaller.sh
 - Every time you want to invoke the launcher, type "letsgoracing" in your terminal.
 - Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
 
## VLSI VM

 - Under development
 

# To:do
 - VLSI installer script.
 - Main script to invoke the rest.

This script assumes a FRESH installation of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Happy experimentation!
