# VMScripts
Scripts I use to personalize my VM installations.

I have a collection of VM's, each of which serve a different purpose for me.

The long-term plan is for these scripts to serve as a ready-to-run resource to
turn any fresh Ubuntu installation into a complete toolchain for R&D. 

# Note

The scripts are located in the CommunityInstallers branch of this tree.
Follow the instructions in the README there.
