# VMScripts - CommunityInstallers

This branch houses the launchers and installers for the environments.
The software stack given is by no means exhaustive, but a good starting
point for learning. If you know how to work with BASH, feel free to extend
the scripts and personalize them, otherwise as I come across other software
that is useful, you can wait until this branch is updated again.

# Usage
 - Create Ubuntu VM and clone this repository inside it.
 - Run Git Command: git checkout CommunityInstallers
 - Run Top Level Script: ./CreateEnvironment.sh 

# To:do
 - VLSI installer script.

This script assumes a FRESH installation of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Happy experimentation!
